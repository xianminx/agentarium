Ticket, 
Now we have a list of agents, could you help me implement a chat interface for each agent? It would be great if it can be reused with agenttask detail page or share as much code as possible. 
When I click on an agent from the list, it should open a chat page where I can send messages to the agent and receive responses. the chat interface should display the conversation history between me and the agent, with my messages aligned to the right and the agent's responses aligned to the left.
